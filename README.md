# Size Recommendation App

This app was developded for testing purposes during my graduation project. It implements a simple but efficient algorithm to predict user's size of a certain product (garment) as a function of uses's body measuerments and brand's size chart.

Required measurements differ according to the type of the garment.

- height, chest, waist, neckline, and arm length are required for top garments 
- height, hips, and inseam are required for bottom garments
